# Web Scraping and NLP with Requests, BeautifulSoup, and spaCy

Complete the tasks in the Python Notebook in this repository.
Make sure to add and push the pkl or text file of your scraped html (this is specified in the notebook)

This repository is for exploring text using Requests, BeautifulSoup, and spaCy.  An article will be scraped from the web and then tokens and lexems will be found from it.  

## How to Install and Run the Project

First you must clone the project to your local machine.

1. Copy the URL of the GitHub Repository you would like
2. Open Powershell and run the following commands

```shell
cd \
cd Projects
git clone https://github.com/**account**/**repo-name**
cd **repo-name**
code . 
```

If .gitignore and/or requirements.txt aren't created, create them.

After creating these files we can now Git add-commit-push using the following code in the terminal

```shell
git add . 
git commit -m "YOUR MESSAGE HERE"
git push -u origin main
```

Once pushed, we now create our virtual environment by running the command:

```shell
py -m venv .venv
```

Now we will activate the virtual environment using this command:

```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Once the virtual environment has been activated, we can install our dependencies from requirements.txt.

Before installing, it's best to update key packages first.

```shell
py -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Lastly, we will select our VS Code Interpreter

1. Press Ctrl+Shift+P
2. Search for "Python: Select Interpreter"
3. Choose the Interpreter for the local .venv 

Now your project is ready and the real fun can begin

Don't forget to regularly Git add-commit-push to keep everything up to date
